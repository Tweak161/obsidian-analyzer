**Key Words**: Impulskontrolle, impulse control, Schlechte Gewohnheit, Bad Habit

# Sources
https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-break-a-habit#visualize

# Problem
- Emotions drive behaviour, not logic.
	- We do something before we are aware of it
		- e.g. opening Youtube, checking the smartphone, opening mydealz
# Technique
1.  Practice how to recognize an urge before you act impulsively.
2.  Put a name on that urge. For example, “This is anger I feel.”
3.  Identify the action that emotion is leading you to. For example, “I want to criticize my spouse (because I’m angry).”
4.  Identify what you need to do to stop the impulsive behavior. For example, “I need to express my frustration without making it personal.” Or, “I need to step away, take a moment, and come back later.”
5.  Approach the situation once your urge has decreased.
6.  Document your emotion, what you felt like doing, and what you ended up doing.

# Making of a bad Habit
-   **Reminder.** 
	- This is a trigger, or cue, that could be a:
		- ==conscious behavior==, such as arriving home, flushing the toilet
		- or a ==feeling==, such as boredom, loneliness, nervousness.
-   **Routine.** 
	- This is the behavior associated with the trigger. 
	- Flushing the toilet cues you to wash your hands, while feeling nervous triggers b
