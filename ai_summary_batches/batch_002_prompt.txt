# About
The goal of my PKM is:
- Fast and sustained learning. For Live.
- Be more productive and efficient. Through broad knowledge and fast lookup.
- Maximization of Hapiness. For myself and everyone. Through more clarity and focus on thoughts and projects that are alligned with my values

# Lists
The Lists in this section are used for Tracking the Status of all open PKM Taks. Tasks can be:
- Processing of Inputs (e.g. Podcasts, Youtube, Books)
- Creating and Processing Evergreen Notes

The Status of PKM Tasks is indicated by following Tags:
- üü•Start consuming and processing (understand, take notes) of Input
- üüß Finish consuming and processing of Input
- üü® Synthesize Notes
		- Create Meta Notes (e.g. link Notes to existing Notes find key poitns, ...)
		- Create Seedlings for Evergreen Forest
		- Create Anki Cards (optional for remembering)
- üü© Done

Allows to keep an overview over all notes that need Processing. This is curcial, because notes that are not fully processed and turned into permanent notes will be forgotten and cannot be found easily due to incomplete linkin
