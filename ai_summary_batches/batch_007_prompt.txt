**Key Words**: Impulskontrolle, impulse control, Schlechte Gewohnheit, Bad Habit

# Sources
https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-break-a-habit#visualize

# Problem
- Emotions drive behaviour, not logic.
	- We do something before we are aware of it
		- e.g. opening Youtube, checking the smartphone, opening mydealz
# Technique
1.  Practice how to recognize an urge before you act impulsively.
2.  Put a name on that urge. For example, “This is anger I feel.”

4.  Identify what you need to do to stop the impulsive behavior. For example, “I need to express my frustration without making it personal.” Or, “I need to step away, take a moment, and come back later.”
5.  Approach the situation once your urge has decreased.
6.  Document your emotion, what you felt like doing, and what you ended up doing.

# Making of a bad Habit
